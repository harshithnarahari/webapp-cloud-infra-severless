java web application deployed on aws cloud

I've used almost all the features that amazon aws cloud services offers

integrated java web api with cloud

implemented CI with github actions

utilized packer to build AMIs

utilized sendgrid mail servers for exploring sns topic, lambda

used namecheap domain name for the webapp, webapp will be hosted in prod.harshithnarahari.me domain

I'm a huge cloud enthusiast so I would love to discuss this further with anyone who's interested!
